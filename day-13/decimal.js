//You are going to create a terminal-based calculator program using Node. 
// 1. Handle remainders properly (modulo). Example : 9 divided by 4 would  print 2.25 
// 2. Make the program more elegant by allowing the user to enter an entire  operation on one line such as: ‘’6 / 6’’ or ‘’5 * 3’’ (Hint use arguments to  solve this)
